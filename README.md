# ihs-girls-who-code
Our website: https://www.ihsgirlswhocode.com/

Preview link: https://ihs-gwc.github.io/

The real website (the first link) is hosted on cPanel. Unlike the preview, the real website doesn't update automatically when some code is changed. 

# cPanel
We are using cPanel to host our website. Files will be uploaded to cPanel via [pull deployment](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/web-services/guide-to-git-deployment/#manual-or-pull-deployment). Let us know if you have made a change on GitHub, so we can upload and deploy it on cPanel.
